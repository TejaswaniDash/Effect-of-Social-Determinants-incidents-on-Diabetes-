# Effect-of-Social-Determinants-incidents-on-Diabetes

This code performs various operations related to data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation. Let's break down the code into sections and explain each part:

1. Data Preprocessing:
Loading Data:
The code loads data from an Excel file named "BCwithTime and Order.xlsx" into a pandas DataFrame df.
It assigns new columns (bc_1, bc_2) by mapping the values from the original columns (BC1, BC2) using a dictionary v2c.
It renames some columns and drops unnecessary columns.
Constructing Matrix M:
It constructs a matrix M where each element represents the negative sum of n_1 and n_2 values for corresponding bc_1 and bc_2 pairs in the DataFrame df.
2. Calculating Rankings and Correlation:
Calculating Rank Scores:
It calculates rank scores using the matrix M, a coefficient vector b, and an equation. The result is stored in a DataFrame my_rank_data.
Sorting and Displaying Rankings:
The rank scores are sorted in ascending order and displayed in a DataFrame my_rank_data_sorted.
Calculating Correlation Matrix:
It calculates the correlation matrix Correlation_Matrix of matrix C, where C is a modified version of M with additional operations.
3. Model Training and Evaluation:
Training Lasso Regression Model:
It trains a Lasso regression model using the data loaded from a CSV file.
Hyperparameter Tuning:
It tunes the hyperparameters of the Lasso model using cross-validation.
Model Evaluation:
It evaluates the trained model on the training and test datasets, calculating the R-squared values and plotting the ROC curve.
4. Visualization:
Heatmap Visualization:
It visualizes the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
Plotting Coefficient Paths:
It plots the coefficient paths for different values of the regularization parameter alpha in Lasso regression.
Plotting Mean Square Error vs. Alpha:
It plots the mean square error on each fold of cross-validation against different alpha values.
5. Output:
Printing Ordering:
It prints the ordering of items based on rank scores.
6. Additional Functions:
Helper Functions:
There are helper functions defined earlier in the code for data manipulation, calculation, and visualization.
Overall, this code performs data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization tasks related to the provided dataset.
